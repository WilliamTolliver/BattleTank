 Camera control:
 Use an Azimoth Aim on X axis to control rotation around a horizontal ONLY plane respective of the ground plane.
	- Add this to the localRotation component
	- This localRotation should target the Azimuth Gimbal, so that it affects only X rotation
	
Use an input Axis Vertical component to control rotation around a Spring arm component.
	- The Local rotation component should target the spring arm itself.
	-  Use a multiplier to configure the rotation speed.
